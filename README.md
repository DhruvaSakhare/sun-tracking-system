In today's times, electricity has become very essential for mankind. Increasing demand for electricity leads to the depletion of the coal and fossil fuel available to humans. As fossil fuels are bound to get exhausted and also not being a clean source of energy is another added disadvantage. In this era of enormous energy demand, wide research and development of renewable sources of energy is mandatory. The use of solar energy can be advantageous to great extent. To make most of the power from photovoltaic cells, development should focus on getting greater efficiencies using Solar panel arrays.
